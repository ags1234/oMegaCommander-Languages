# oMegaCommander-Languages/Plugins

Plugins folder for oMega Commander

Plugins may or may not need Language files.
In any event such files are located in "Languages" subfolder of each plugin folder. 
Each language needs one or two files:
.lng - all internal application element labels, texts, messages
.ini - all default names for various customizable elements

To start with a language copy en.lng.MasterCopy and en.ini.MasterCopy, renaming them and removing ".MasterCopy". 
To help you with translation work use the embedded Language Editor.
Once you are in a folder with .lng files, a small orange LNG button pops up next to the navigation breadcrumbs.
See http://pylonos.com/omega/features#lngeditor for details on how to use the Language Editor.
