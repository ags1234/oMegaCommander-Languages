Localizations for oMega Commander file manager

This is the root folder for oMega Commander, where oMega32.exe and oMega64.exe are located.

Culture resources are placed in the "Languages" subfolder, and for each plugin in appropriate "Languages".
They typically consist from one or two files:
.lng - all internal application element labels, texts, messages
.ini - all default names for various customizable elements

To start with a language copy en.lng.MasterCopy and en.ini.MasterCopy, renaming them and removing ".MasterCopy". 
To help you with translation work use the embedded Language Editor.
Once you are in a folder with .lng files, a small orange LNG button pops up next to the navigation breadcrumbs.
See http://pylonos.com/omega/features#lngeditor for details on how to use the Language Editor.
